Hi! I'm Bing-Chen (Benson) Chiu, currently a 4th-year undergraduate student in the [Department of Information Management](https://management.ntu.edu.tw/IM) at National Taiwan University. My passion lies at the intersection of **human-computer interaction (HCI)** and **generative AI**. Advised by Prof. [Nanyi Bi](https://management.ntu.edu.tw/IM/faculty/teacher/sn/430) at the **Human-Computer Interaction and Collaboration Lab**, I actively explore how advanced technologies can enhance **daily interactions**, **productivity**, and **overall well-being**.

I'm also highly enthusiastic about teaching, sharing knowledge, and guiding peers to achieve their learning goals. Beyond academics, I'm committed to personal growth, continually refining my communication, leadership, and creative problem-solving skills. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, exploring diverse cuisines, and cycling, which help me stay curious, energized, and connected to the world around me.
